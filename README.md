## üî¨ LLM Research Study

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/Shubham2376G/AI_Projects/blob/main/utils/Images/bitnet.jpg"> **[1-bit LLM](https://github.com/Shubham2376G/AI_Projects/tree/main/LLM_Cookbook/1_bit)**

- Reimplemented **Microsoft‚Äôs 1-BitNet**, which leverages **1-bit quantization** for training large-scale LLMs, drastically reducing memory and communication cost.
- **Key Insight:** 1-bit quantization, combined with error compensation, enables near full-precision accuracy while significantly lowering training overhead.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/Shubham2376G/AI_Projects/blob/main/utils/Images/LLM_Distillation.jpg"> **[Knowledge Distillation](https://github.com/Shubham2376G/AI_Projects/tree/main/LLM_Cookbook/knowledge_distilation)**

- Implemented a **teacher‚Äìstudent learning pipeline** to compress large LLMs into smaller ones, reducing inference cost while retaining high performance.
- **Key Insight:** A well-designed student model can achieve near-teacher accuracy with far fewer parameters, making deployment more efficient and fast.
#

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/Shubham2376G/AI_Projects/blob/main/utils/Images/sd.jpg"> **[Speculative Decoding](https://github.com/Shubham2376G/AI_Projects/tree/main/LLM_Cookbook/speculative_decoding)**

- Implemented speculative decoding to **accelerate LLM inference** by letting a smaller draft model propose multiple tokens, which are then selectively verified by a larger target model.
- **Key Insight:** parallelizing token generation using lightweight draft model significantly speeds up decoding while maintaining the accuracy of the main model.
